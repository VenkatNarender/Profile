           <p> Area 51 is a highly classified U.S. Air Force facility located in Nevada. 
            It has long been associated with conspiracy theories, secret aircraft testing, and UFO sightings. 
            Though its true purpose remains undisclosed, it is believed to be a site for advanced aerospace research and development.
            All research and occurrences in Area 51 are Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI).[6] The CIA publicly 
            acknowledged the base's existence on 25 June 2013, through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request filed in 2005; 
            it has declassified documents detailing its history and purpose.[7] The intense secrecy surrounding the base has made 
            it the frequent subject of conspiracy theories and a central component of unidentified flying object (UFO) folklore.[8][9]
